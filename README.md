# Crime Data Analysis 🚔

## 📌 Project Overview  
Los Angeles, California 😎 — The City of Angels, Tinseltown, and the Entertainment Capital of the World!  
Known for its warm weather, palm trees, sprawling coastline, and Hollywood, it also faces challenges like crime.  

This project analyzes **Los Angeles crime data** to identify crime patterns and trends.  
The goal is to assist the **Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)** in allocating resources effectively to reduce crime rates.

## 🔍 Objectives  
- Analyze crime trends across time and location.  
- Identify the most common types of crimes.  
- Detect crime-prone areas (hotspots).  
- Provide visual insights for better understanding.
